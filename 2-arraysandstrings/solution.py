# Given an array of size n, where the values are between 1 and n inclusive and
# each value may at most appear twice, return a List of all the duplicate
# elements. All tests have duplicates occur in ascending order (i.e. a duplicate
# 1 would occur before a duplicate 2, etc), so your output MUST have the
# duplicates in ascending order!
